					<h2>About</h2>
						<div class="paragraph">
							<p><br>The Fat Free Project&#39;s development team has over 55 years of combined coding and design 
							experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, we&#39;ve done a ridiculous amount of gaming.&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;ve witnessed 
							catastrophic failures, transcendental successes, and everything in between.&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, we&#39;ve 
							learned firsthand what works and what doesn&#39;t.</p><br>
							<p>The staff of the Fat Free Project have always believed gaming is the most immersive way to 
							tell a story.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have stories of our own to tell and the ability to tell them.</p><br>
							<p>Our approach to game design focuses on stripping away the elements of games that everyone 
							hates until all that remains are the elements driving the story forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;You won&#39;t find 
							pointless or respawning enemies, cut scenes, escort mission, or endless grinding to get your 
							level up.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just satisfying, meaningful gaming and hopefully a few memories along the way.</p><br>
							<p>In the coming year we will be designing and beta testing a new game.&nbsp;&nbsp;For updates, follow 
							us on <a href="https://twitter.com/fatfreeproject/">Twitter</a>, or sign up for our mailing 
							list and we&#39;ll let you know when our official website and game blog goes live.</p><br>
